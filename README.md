## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

My name in Ivan and I am currently studying a tech conversion course: 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about my previous career teaching Maths in a UK secondary school
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I once swam in the highest lake in the world whilst completing the Annapurna Circuit in Nepal!
